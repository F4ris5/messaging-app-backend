# This is the backend for a Messaging App

This is the backend for the Messaging App that handles API calls for adding, deleting new users. It also handles the message database using a PosgreSQL instance. This project is currently hosted on Railway so it could be online right now (depending on my wallet's condition).

## Running Locally

If you want to run this locally, you need to have a PosgreSQL on your device. Donwload this code and open it, change the db.js file to connect to your database properly. The routing also needs to be changed to connect to the frontend [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
